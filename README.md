# Example project

1. Start it using ./manage.py runserver
2. Go to http://localhost:8000/admin/pages/3/edit/
3. Login using admin:admin
4. Check one (or both) of the checkboxes next to *sites*
5. "Publish" the page
6. Go to http://localhost:8000/admin/pages/3/edit/

As you'll see the checkboxes are not checked anymore.
